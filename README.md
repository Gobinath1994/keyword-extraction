## Overview

Customer support chat logs contain valuable information about customer issues, product feedback, and more. However, manually reviewing these logs can be time-consuming and error-prone. This tool automates the process of **extracting relevant keywords** from customer messages, allowing companies to quickly identify patterns and improve their services.

### Key Objectives

- Extract meaningful **keywords** from customer messages.
- Build an **interactive UI** with Streamlit for easy exploration.
- Visualize the **most frequent keywords** across multiple chat logs.

---

## Key Features

- üîç **Keyword Extraction**: Extracts unigrams and bigrams (e.g., "slow performance", "freezing", "system issues") from customer messages.
- üß≠ **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly web interface to upload chat logs, view keywords, and search/filter messages.
- üìä **Top Keyword Visualization**: Bar chart displaying the most common keywords extracted from all messages.
- üíæ **Data Export**: Export the extracted keywords and original messages to a CSV file.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pandas** ‚Äì Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **KeyBERT** & **Sentence-Transformers** ‚Äì Keyword extraction using pre-trained models.
- **Streamlit** ‚Äì Interactive web application.
- **Matplotlib** ‚Äì Visualization.
- **TQDM** ‚Äì Progress bars for long operations.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Set Up a Python Environment

Using conda:

```bash
conda create -n keyword-extraction python=3.10
conda activate keyword-extraction
```

Or using virtualenv:

```bash
python -m venv keyword-extraction
source keyword-extraction/bin/activate  # On Windows: keyword-extraction\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import pandas, streamlit, keybert, torch"
```

If no errors appear, you‚Äôre good to go!

---

## Usage

### 1. Batch Processing (without UI)

Run the script to process chat logs:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Load the customer support chat logs.
- Extract keywords from the messages.
- Save the results to `outputs/cleaned_keywords.csv`.

---

### 2. Streamlit UI

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch a web interface where you can:
- Upload your chat logs in CSV format.
- View and explore the extracted keywords.
- Visualize keyword frequencies in a bar chart.
- Filter messages by specific keywords.

---

## Streamlit Interface

1. **Upload Chat Log CSV**  
   Upload a CSV file containing chat logs with columns: `chat_id`, `role`, and `message`.

2. **Keyword Extraction**  
   The app will automatically extract keywords from customer messages after uploading.

3. **Search and Filter**  
   Search for a specific keyword and filter messages containing it.

4. **Visualize Top Keywords**  
   View a bar chart showing the most frequently used keywords.

---

## Output

The output CSV file (`cleaned_keywords.csv`) contains:

| chat_id | message                                | keywords                          |
|---------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1       | My system is freezing after an update  | freezing, system, recent update   |
| 2       | My system is slowing down              | slowing down, system              |

---

## Future Improvements

- üß† **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment of customer messages (positive/neutral/negative).
- üóÇÔ∏è **Issue Categorization**: Group messages into categories (e.g., ‚Äútechnical issue‚Äù, ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù).
- üîÅ **Real-Time Chat Integration**: Extend to process live chat streams.
- üìà **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add word clouds, time-series trends, etc.
